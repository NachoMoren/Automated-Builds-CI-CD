# Automated Builds CI + CD
In software development, building is the process that describes the conversion of files and other assets to create a software product that works in its intended form. This procedure includes compiling source files, packaging compiled files into compressed formats, producing installers and creating or updating database schemas. So, whenever we talk about an automated build, it means that there is no human intervention during this building process. Build automation is possible when the steps involved in the build are repeatable and can be performed using just the information that has already been stored in the source code control repository by the developers. Furthermore, build automation is a first step of any CI/CD process.
